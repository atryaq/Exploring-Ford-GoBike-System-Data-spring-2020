# Exploring Ford GoBike System Data (spring 2020)
## by Ahmed Tryaq


## Dataset

This data set includes details about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area during the period from April to June (spring 2020).


## Summary of Findings

- Most of customers were **casual customers**, and most of bikes rided were **electric bikes**. <br>
- **Casual customers** who used **docked bikes** have the heighst chances for having a very **long** trip. While **members** who used **electric bikes** are related with the **least trip duration**.
- Number of trips each week increases over time.
- Visually, there is a potential negative correlation between number of rides per week and mean ride duration, however, further analysis is required for asessing this relationship.
